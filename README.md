Implemented three algorithms with different performances that use a graph, list and disjoint set structure to solve the TSP problem for various different configurations. The data used is from the website http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/world/countries.html.
The file "podaci.pdf" contains performance comparisons of the 3 algorithms with the performance of the best tested algorithms given on the website.
